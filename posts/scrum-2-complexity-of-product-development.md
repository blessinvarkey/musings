## The Stacey matrix
A method to select the appropriate management actions in a complex adaptive system based on the degree of certainty and level of agreement on the issue in question. [R1]

### Close to Certainity 
Issues or decisions are close to certainty when cause and effect linkages can be determined. This is usually the case when a very similar issue or decision has been made in the past. One can then extrapolate from past experience to predict the outcome of an action with a good degree of certainty. [R1]

### Far from Certainty
At the other end of the certainty continuum are decisions that are far from certainty. These situations are often unique or at least new to the decision makers. The cause and effect linkages are not clear. Extrapolating from past experience is not a good method to predict outcomes in the far from certainty range.[R1]

### Agreement
The vertical axis measures the level of agreement about an issue or decision within the group, team or organization. As you would expect, the management or leadership function varies depending on the level of agreement surrounding an issue.[R1]

## Zones within the matrix
## 1. Simple: Everything is known (Close to agreement, close to certainty)
In this technique we use techniques which gather data from the past and use it to predict the future. We can plan specific paths of action to achieve outcomes and monitor the actual behaviour by comparing it against these plans. The goal is to repeat what works to improve efficiency and effectiveness. [R1]
  - Data can be gathered from the past that can be used to predict the future. 
  - Construction and engineering projects typically have a wealth of technical data that allows them to be well specified and scheduled before delivery work starts. 
  - Work is controlled by monitoring against detailed plans. [R2]

## 2. Complicated: More is known than unknown 
### Far from agreement, close to certainty
Some issues have a great deal of certainty about how outcomes are created but high levels of disagreement about which outcomes are desirable. Neither plans nor shared mission are likely to work in this context. Instead, politics become more important. Coalition building, negotiation, and compromise are used to create the organization's agenda and direction. [R1]
  - Some projects are very certain about which objectives are possible and how they can be delivered but there is less agreement about which objectives are of greatest value. 
  - This may be exemplified by a project manager who has trouble developing a business case that is acceptable to multiple stakeholders who have differing views on value.
  - Skills such as negotiation, reaching a compromise and developing coalitions are important. Decision making becomes political rather than technical. 
###  Close to agreement, far from certainty
Some issues have a high level of agreement but not much certainty as to the cause and effect linkages to create the desired outcomes. In these cases, monitoring against a preset plan will not work. A strong sense of shared mission or vision may substitute for a plan in these cases. Comparisons are made not against plans but against the mission and vision for the organization. In this region, the goal is to head towards an agreed upon future state even though the specific paths cannot be predetermined.[R1]
  - Projects may have a high level of agreement about the desired objectives but not much certainty about the cause and effect linkages that will result in the desired objectives. 
  - Relationships between outputs, outcomes and benefits can often fall into this category when assumptions are made about how outputs will lead to benefits.
  - A strong sense of shared vision among the stakeholders is necessary and a flexible and realistic approach to planning. 
  - The project manager and sponsor must visibly head towards an agreed future state (blueprint) even though specific paths are not fully predetermined.

## 3. Complex: More is unknown than known (The zone of complexity)
In the zone of complexity the traditional management approaches are not very effective but it is the zone of high creativity, innovation, and breaking with the past to create new modes of operating.[R1]
  - This zone covers an area where the combination of low levels agreement or low levels of certainty make the project a complex management problem. 
  - This is the area that often triggers poor decision-making practices, when what it really needs are high levels of creativity, innovation and freedom from past constraints to create new solutions.
  - Adaptability and agility are key skills here, not just for the project manager but for the sponsor, team members and stakeholders. Approaches such as Concurrent Engineering and Systems Thinking are useful here.[R2]

## 4. Chaotic: Very little is known (Far from agreement, far from certainty)
Situations where there are very high levels of uncertainty and disagreement, often result in a breakdown or anarchy. The traditional methods of planning, visioning, and negotiation are insufficient in these contexts. One personal strategy to deal with such contexts is avoidance - avoiding the issues that are highly uncertain and where there is little disagreement. While this may be a protective strategy in the short run, it is disastrous in the long run. This is a region that organizations should avoid as much as possible.[R1]
  - Where there is little agreement and little certainty, anarchy can prevail. 
  - Individuals and organisations sometimes resort to avoidance but such situations cannot always be avoided. 
  - Strategies are needed to address these situations should they occur.
  - This zone is often referred to as chaos rather than anarchy and the boundary between this and the zone of complexity is known as the ‘Edge of chaos’. [R2]

Scrum is a framework that outperforms predictive methods, such as scientific management or waterfall, in this complex domain because it uses empirical process control (Latre, 2019).
