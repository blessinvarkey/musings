# The Agile Mindset

- Experiment with new techniques and processes
- Share knowledge new collaboration
- Emergent Leadership 
- Practice Servant Leadership


## Agile Manifesto

- __Individuals and interactions__ over processes and tools
    - People complete projects, negotiate, do knowledge work 
    - Processes create repeatable results 
- __Working software__ over comprehensive documentation
    - Very little value in documentation
    - Comments are okay, excess documentation is a waste
- __Customer collaboration__ over contract negotiation: 
    - Contracts must accomodate change
    - Contracts are mostly rigid and uncooperative 
- __Responding to change__ over following a plan
    - Projects are change driven
    - Uncertainity upfront

## Principles behind the Agile Manifesto
- Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
- Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.
- Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
- Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
- Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
- The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
- Working software is the primary measure of progress.
- Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
- Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
- Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential.
- The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
- At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.
