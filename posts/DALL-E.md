# DALL-E

One of the astounding papers recently published in machine learning research is DALL-E (a portmanteau of  WALL-E and Salvador Dalí.), OpenAI's image generation model. 

DALL-E is a **12-billion parameter** version of **GPT-3** trained to generate images from text descriptions, using a dataset of text–image pairs. It can create anthropomorphized versions of animals and objects, combining unrelated concepts in plausible ways, rendering text, and applying transformations to existing images.[1]
